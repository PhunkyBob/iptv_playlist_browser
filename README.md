### Preferences
![preferences](documentation/preferences.png)
#### Video player
Give a path to your favorite video player executable.  
Eg. : `C:/Program Files (x86)/VideoLAN/VLC/vlc.exe`
#### Additional parameters
(optional) You can provide additional parameters to use with your player. 

Eg. : `--fullscreen` will launch VLC in fullscreen.  

#### Remember latest input
When checked, by default the program will remember your playlist local or remote path, and your Xtream code credentials.  


#### Always try to retreive Xtream Code
When checked, if you load a playlist the program will first give a try to the Xtream Code API.  
Xtream Code API allows to have better group naming and to play catch up streams. 

#### Group / category separator
Very often the channels in the playlist are separated by false channels to mark the boundary.  
Whith this parameter, you can specify what are the strings used as separator. 

Eg. : if your playlist is like 
```
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1,< CHAINES FRANCAISES SD >
http://myserver.com:8000/login/password/1
#EXTINF:-1,--- TNT SD ---
http://myserver.com:8000/login/password/2
#EXTINF:-1,TF1 SD
http://myserver.com:8000/login/password/3
#EXTINF:-1,TF1 +1 SD
http://myserver.com:8000/login/password/4
#EXTINF:-1,FRANCE 2 SD
http://myserver.com:8000/login/password/5
#EXTINF:-1,FRANCE 3 SD
http://myserver.com:8000/login/password/6
```
and you set 
```
<
```
as group separator and 
```
--
``` 
as category separator, all lines containing `<` will be considered as "group" and all lines containing `--` will be considered as "category".
